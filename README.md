Tether is a JavaScript library for efficiently making an absolutely positioned element stay next to another element on the page.

Elements can be positioned manually but if you wanted them to change positions when a window resizes, you will need to have crafted those elements with that in mind. When you have multiples of these positioned and reacting differently, you suddenly have a lot more work. 

Tether's goal is to ease this kind of work by providing such functionality so that you don't have to worry about document flow for those kinds of uniquely placed elements (tooltips and banners for example). These elements can be attached with a simple constructor and has various options available such as repositioning after certain scroll thresholds, or keeping an element confined within an area.

It aims to be the canonical implementation of this type of positioning, such that you can build products, not positioning libraries.
Take a look at the documentation for a more detailed explanation of why you should star it now to remember it for your next project.
